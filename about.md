Hello, my name is Mitchell Oucharek. I am a recent graduate of the Software Development program at SAIT, where I focused my studies on full-stack JavaScript development. 

### More Information

I've done quite a few things - keep an eye out for projects I'm working on in the Blog section of the site. The first two were for my independent study on Node.js this semester, but I'm hoping to add a few more.
