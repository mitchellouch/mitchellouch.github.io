##  Blog Post 2: A Node to JavaScript

Welcome back dear reader, 

Despite what the title says, this will not be an ode to JavaScript. However, I wanted to start by saying that working with NodeJS has truly deepened my appreciation for the language, officially making me a Level 2 JavaScript fanboy. Enjoy the post!  

WEB DEV IMAGE

## Introduction

So, you want to build your very own NodeJS app? Well buckle up because I’m going to show exactly how you can building a fancy NodeJS app that will inject views into users’ browsers and store data in a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) cloud-based non-relational database! We’re going to be using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to set up our web server and our routes, [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to connect our database and create schemas, and since we all have some experience using .jsp pages, let’s use [EJS (Embedded JavaScript)](https://ejs.co/) to generate our views. We’re also going to be using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to avoid writing CSS because the year is 2021. We could also write our views in plain old HTML5, or something sleek like [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) or [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) (formerly Jade), but for the sake of familiarity let’s stick to EJS for now. If all the things I just said sound like nonsensical garbage to you, click on the links to read more about these amazing modules. Let’s chat about a few things first though... 

If you haven’t read my previous post, you should at least go read Step 2: google what is nodejs? As a very brief review: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open-source, compiled version of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine, along with the [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) library for cross-platform compatibility, and a core library that is mainly written in JavaScript. It is a runtime environment that we can use to run JavaScript on the server side of web applications, effectively extending JavaScript across the stack. I could go on about how coding web applications in a single language makes it much easier for companies to hire developers, or how unifying the data format with JSON allows developers to efficiently reuse resources, or how an open-source development community allows millions of developers world-wide to drive innovation in JavaScript development forward at incredible rates, but this sentence is already far too long.  

## It's time to get real... real-time

What the rise of NodeJS truly represents is a paradigm shift from the stateless request/response-based web, to the real-time web; we can leverage its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to create real-time websites with push capabilities, where the client and the server can both initiate communications ultimately allowing them to exchange data freely. The real kicker here is that operating on a single thread, NodeJS can asynchronously handle thousands of concurrent connections by holding them in the event loop. The event loop is an entire other blog post that I don’t have time to write but I would highly recommend looking at this image for 5-10 minutes then checking out [this video](https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ):  

NODE SYSTEM MODEL

Let’s consider a traditional web-serving scenario with a rough calculation: each request will spawn a new thread, and if we assume that each thread requires 2MB of memory we can handle around 8000 concurrent requests on a server with 16GB of RAM. Now, let’s go ahead and use NodeJS to gently step around all that business and write some single-threaded web servers. In 2012, someone demonstrated using a fairly low-complexity NodeJS server to handle a [million concurrent connections](https://blog.caustik.com/2012/08/19/node-js-w1m-concurrent-connections/) while only consuming 16GB of memory. In 2015, someone used the Socket.io library run [over 600 thousand concurrent websocket connections](https://blog.jayway.com/2015/04/13/600k-concurrent-websocket-connections-on-aws-using-node-js/) on an AWS M3.xlarge EC2 instance (4 cores, 15GB RAM). There are many other factors to consider here so a direct comparison is difficult, but I really want to highlight the vast difference in scalability that can be achieved by using non-blocking I/O calls.  

With that in mind, here are a few things that are perfectly suited for NodeJS: 

* Data streaming application 
* API for Object Database 
* Real-time application/system monitoring  
* Real-time chat application 
* Proxying infrastructure  

There are, however, a few things that you should not use NodeJS for – namely CPU intensive applications that have large processing requirements on the server-side. These applications are much better suited for multithreaded servers because all incoming requests will be blocked while NodeJS’s single thread works on the computations. __Basically, avoid blocking operations!__ If you’re really keen to do math on your NodeJS web server, there are some workarounds: for example, with a node module called [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) we can pretty easily run multiple NodeJS servers behind a reverse proxy so that if a blocking operation hangs up one server, requests can be redirected to the others. 

Anyways, enough of that. Let's make a Node app! But first, more exposition. I’ve been growing spicy peppers hydroponically in my basement for the last 8 months or so, it has turned into a pretty substantial operation and I’ve been looking for a good way to keep track of all the different kinds of seeds I’ve acquired (there’s a lot of different kinds of peppers). So that’s what I’ll be building today – but keep in mind that you can use these steps to store and display data for anything you want! If you can think of something cooler than pepper seeds, that is.

PEPPER TENT IMAGE

Okay now it’s actually time to make our NodeJS app... But before we can start, let’s take a big step back and talk about how to structure an application like this. I’ll save you the headache and let you know that you won’t necessarily find a “correct” way to structure a node application, just an endless sea of options and opinions. The general consensus seems to be something along the lines of an MVC Architecture, where the “controller” portion is replaced with the more encompassing “middleware”. This is the application structure I’ve been working with so far, but you can really do whatever is right for your application: 

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/SQh1IE1.png "Node app model")

* __Server (app.js):__ this is the main JavaScript file that will launch our application, where we create the web server and import the node modules we’re planning on using.  
* __Middleware:__ this is where I keep any functions that are interpreting incoming requests before being sent to the route handler, perhaps a function for validating sessions or ensuring that the user is logged in before accessing a certain route.  
* __Routes:__ this is where we can define the various routes throughout the application with HTTP methods. This probably doesn’t make total sense right now but it will soon, I promise.  
* __Views:__ this is where we keep all the views we’re planning on sending to the browser, for this application they’ll be written in EJS but I would highly recommend looking into other templating engines like Pug or Mustache. 
* __Models:__ here we can define our database schemas and do some validation with data before sending it to the database.  
* __Public:__ this is standard website stuff; common scripts, static image files, and stylesheets!  

If you’re looking for a quick and easy way to create an application skeleton, you can use a module called express-generator to create a basic Express web application with your desired settings. Playing with it was actually a really useful way to learn a standard structure! 

VERY GOOD MEME

Okay, first thing you need to do is create your `app.js` file and all your folders in a new folder in VS Code (if you’ve done your homework, you should already have node and mongodb installed on your system) and in the terminal (at the location of your app) enter `npm init –y` to create your `package.json` file with default values. This is where we’ll handle all of the dependencies for the various modules we’ll be incorporating into the application. If you don’t have node installed globally for some reason, enter `npm install node` to import the core module add it to the package.json file. After that you can install the rest of the modules the same way, or just install them as you need them! We’ll be using [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to automatically reload our server whenever we make changes, just to streamline the development process – be sure to delete the test script from the scripts object and add a script to start the app with nodemon (line 7 below). Finally, you have to actually install all the dependencies with one last `npm install` once they’re all listed in your `package.json` file. Don’t forget to do this any time you add a new dependency! Add .env and .gitignore files but leave them blank for now, we’ll need them shortly. You should have now something like this:  

```json
{
  "name": "SpicySeedsApp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "devstart": "nodemon app.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "ejs": "^3.1.6",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-session": "^1.17.1",
    "method-override": "^3.0.0",
    "mongodb": "^3.6.6",
    "mongoose": "^5.12.3",
    "node": "^15.12.0",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
  }
}

```

In our main file, let’s just add the absolute minimum boilerplate code for setting up an express app. This means importing the express module, instantiating our app by calling express as a function, and finally telling our app where to listen for requests. Let’s also set our view engine to EJS. With this simple setup, we can use now `app.get()` to create routes for our app starting with a home route at "/" - when we go to connect to our server at `localhost:3000` this route will handle the request. Before we can go any further setting up our routes, it’s also important to know that with `app.use()` we can write middleware to run functions anytime a route receives a request. The usefulness of this will become more apparent soon!  

``` javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send("This is the home page");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Routing is the hardest part of all of this for me to explain but I’m going to try my absolute best – stay with me while we go around in a circle real quick. In our app.js file we could create some routes like /index /login /register but our main file will become extremely large and confusing faster than you think. Consider a website with hundreds of routes, each with specific http methods and authentication requirements – you’re going to have a big `app.js` file. Rather than having these routes in our main file, let’s create a new file called seeds.js in our routes folder.  

``` javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send("This is the seeds page");
});

router.get("/new", (req, res) => {
	res.send("This is the add new seed page");
});

module.exports = router;
```

Using the express router, we can define all of our routes in separate files, then export those files to anywhere they are needed. As such, we can now import our routes into our main file, and then use a middleware to automatically use that route whenever the /seeds route is requested. 

``` javascript
const seedsRoute = require("./routes/seeds");
app.use("/seeds", seedsRoute);
```

If we look back at our `seeds.js` file in the routes folder, we can see that all routes imported from that file will be preceded by /seeds (so “/” is actually “/seeds” and “/new” is actually “/seeds/new” thanks to the middleware we just made). As we create new routes, we can assign them new views or reuse existing views with different data. This is where I often start to feel like I have a lot of balls in the air, it’s easy to get lost in your routes so do a good job of planning your application structure to avoid the headache. Fortunately, this means that anytime we need to work on seed-related areas of the site, we can just work in this route to stay organized! 

Before we go any further setting up our routes, let’s setup our free MongoDB Atlas database with a basic cluster and connect it to our node application with mongoose. Import and install mongoose if you haven’t already, and then in your `app.js` file you can just add `mongoose.connect()` to start working on getting the database connected. If you’re following along, you’ll likely start getting some dependency errors here – don’t worry, the errors should walk you through the settings that need to be changed and you can just pass them as arguments into the connect function. Alternatively, you can set them individually with `mongoose.set()` which is what I’ve done here:

``` javascript
mongoose.set("useNewUrlParser", true);
mongoose.set("useUnifiedTopology", true);
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.DB_CONNECTION)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Database connection successful!");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log("ERROR: Database connection failed!");
  });
```

Let's take a look at the argument being passed into the connection function `process.env.DB_CONNECTION`: this is simply a variable that we're storing in a .env file we created at the start. We'll probably have to upload our code to github to deploy it so we don’t want any secret information visible in the code. Using a nifty module called dotenv we can define our connection code in the .env file, import it with `require("dotenv/config");` and then ensure it won’t be uploaded to the public repository by including it in the .gitignore file (along with node_modules but that’s just good practice). I'll show you how to connect your cloud database in the [video at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5Wc-Tssac)! 

Once the database is connected, we can use mongoose to send and receive data according to our routes. Speaking of data, we also need to tell our application what the data we’ll be working with is going to look like so let’s make a schema for Seed. In your models folder, create a new file called `Seed.js` - this is the same as any other database schema, simply define the fields that constitute a Seed object! Personally, I mainly care about the name, species, source, and quantity of my seeds, but I’m also adding an optional field for description in case there’s anything else worth mentioning about them. Once the schema is complete, we can export it the same way we did with our routes before; 

``` javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const SeedSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  desc: {
    type: String,
    required: false,
  },
  species: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  source: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  quantity: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
  },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("Seed", SeedSchema);
```

Then back in the main file, we can import Seed from our models folder.  

``` javascript
const Seed = require("./models/Seed");
```

What’s that? You don’t like the back end? You think it’s scary and bad? Not to worry dearest reader, it’s time to create some views for our app to display in the browser and it’s going to feel really good and familiar. The basic concept here is that we can render views in the callback functions of our routes, and by calling them in this way we can pass route-specific data for each view to render on the page. Let’s just start off with a main page; in your views folder create a new file called `index.ejs`. Like I mentioned before, I’m just using Bootstrap to avoid writing css but you can just use a normal stylesheet for your views if you’d rather – just link it to your ejs files from your public/css folder the same way you would for a normal website.

            <td><strong>Species</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Source</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Quantity</strong></td>
          </tr>

        <tbody>
          <% seeds.forEach(seed => { %>
          <tr>
            <td><%= seed.name %></td>
            <td><%= seed.desc %></td>
            <td><%= seed.species %></td>
            <td><%= seed.source %></td>
            <td><%= seed.quantity %></td>
          </tr>
          <% }) %>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

```
On this page, we just want a title and a table that will show all of the seeds we’ve got stored in the database. How are we going to get all of our seed data into this ejs file you may ask? This can be easily done by passing an object `{ seeds: seeds }` with the function that renders the view. Next, how do we get all of seed data from the database when the page loads? Once again, easily done using mongoose’s `.find()` function within the callback function for our home route. Let's also use the `async` and `await` keywords to turn this into an asynchronous function, since we don't want to app the get hung up looking for the Seed in the database. It should look like this: 

``` javascript
app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  const seeds = await Seed.find();
  res.render("index", { seeds: seeds });
});
```
Great, now we’ve got a home route and a table being displayed in the browser but nothing in it. The next thing we’re going to have to do it create a way to add new seeds to the database – there's a few pieces here but let’s bask in the light of the front-end for another moment to start. Create a folder called “seeds” inside of your views folder, then add a new file called `newSeed.ejs`. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    />
    <script

      integrity="sha384-JEW9xMcG8R+pH31jmWH6WWP0WintQrMb4s7ZOdauHnUtxwoG2vI5DkLtS3qm9Ekf"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    ></script>
    <title>New Seed</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="mb-4">New Seed</h1>
      <form action="/seeds" method="POST">
        <%- include("_newseedform") %>
      </form>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

This page is going to hold the form to send seed data to the database, but let’s take advantage of this templating engine technology and create the form-group of inputs as a snippet (in case we want to reuse it somewhere else later... for example, editing seed info would require the exact same form). Make another file called `_newSeedForm.ejs` with your inputs in a form-group and then just include it inside of the form on your `newSeed.ejs` page using `<%- include(“_newSeedForm”) %>`. 

```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="name">Name</label>
  <input required 
    type="text" 
    name="name" 
    id="name" 
    class="form-control" 
  />
  <label for="desc">Description</label>
  <textarea
    required
    type="text"
    name="desc"
    id="desc"
    class="form-control"
  ></textarea>
  <label for="species">Species</label>
  <input
    required
    type="text"
    name="species"
    id="species"
    class="form-control"
  />
  <label for="source">Source</label>
  <input required type="text" name="source" id="source" class="form-control" />
  <label for="quantity">Quantity</label>
  <input
    required
    type="number"
    name="quantity"
    id="quantity"
    class="form-control"
  />
</div>
<a href="/" class="btn btn-secondary">Cancel</a>
<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Save Seed</button>
```

Back in our routes folder we’re going to setup our /new route and then another route for sending seed data from the form to the database as a Seed object; instead of `app.get()` we’re going to use `app.post()` in our seeds route to send the data. We can grab all the values from the form to create a Seed object using `req.body.<input>` and then asynchronously save the seed to the database. After that we just have to redirect back to our home route, where our new seed should be proudly displayed in the table! It’s good practice to put all of these things inside of a try/catch because if any errors happen to make it through to the core NodeJS event loop the app will most likely crash. For this reason, we’ll catch all of our errors by sending an error message back to the caller of each routing callback function. This way, if there is a problem while accessing a certain route, the browser page will display the error to the user rather than the whole app crashing.  

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const Seed = require("../models/Seed");

router.get("/new", (req, res) => {
  res.render("seeds/newSeed", { seed: new Seed() });
});

//submits a new seed
router.post("/", async (req, res) => {
  const seed = new Seed({
    name: req.body.name,
    desc: req.body.desc,
    species: req.body.species,
    source: req.body.source,
    quantity: req.body.quantity,
  });
  try {
    const savedSeed = await seed.save();
    res.redirect("/");
  } catch (err) {
    res.json({ message: err });
  }
});
```

Look at us go, a fancy new node app that will finally give me a good way to log my pepper seeds. Get ready for some niche chili pepper growing community jokes, people. Obviously the first thing I’m going to do is add my Carolina Reaper seeds in there, so that anyone who looks at my seeds will know that I’m growing the undeniable, over 2 million Scoville, Guiness World Record holding, hottest pepper in the world. Alas, the very next day I receive an angry message with no punctuation informing me that “the Carolina Reaper is FAKE and its inventor Ed Currie is a FRAUD because he just called a 7 Pot Primo a CAROLINA REAPER AND-”. You can see where I’m going with this: we need a way to delete seeds from the database (angry caps-lock man is annoying but he also might be right, so let’s take some heat off the site). 

Since we’re still dealing with seeds here, let’s take on trip back into our `seeds.js` file in the routes folder. We can set up this route in a very similar way, simply using `router.delete()` will get us started but there’s a few things to consider first: how can we track which seeds to delete from the database, and how we can use a form to delete an entry when our only method options are `GET` and `POST`. Fortunately, if you’ve checked the database at any point, you can see that MongoDB automatically generates an ID for each object saved. We can set up a quasi-dynamic route by using `/:seedId` rather than the more static routes we’ve been using so far. Creating routes with unique Ids of database objects is useful for a number of reasons. We’re going to use the seedId to tell the application which seed gets deleted, but you could also link each entry to another view with additional details and dynamically generate the data on the page based on the seedId being used as the route. 

```javascript
router.delete("/:seedId", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const deletedSeed = await Seed.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.seedId);
    res.redirect("/");
  } catch (err) {
    res.json({ message: err });
  }
});
```

Finally, there’s just one last thing we need to do before we can delete our shamefully illegitimate Carolina Reaper seeds from the database – one last npm module for the road. This one is called method-override and it’s going to let us override the method of some of our requests to take advantage of that `router.delete()` function Express has so generously provided. Make sure you import it in your `app.js` file and create an override method. Here's what it should look like when you're done:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
require("dotenv/config");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const methodOverride = require("method-override");
const Seed = require("./models/Seed");

app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(methodOverride("_method"));

mongoose.set("useNewUrlParser", true);
mongoose.set("useUnifiedTopology", true);
mongoose.set("useFindAndModify", false);
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.DB_CONNECTION)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Database connection successful!");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log("ERROR: Database connection failed!");
  });

const seedsRoute = require("./routes/seeds");
app.use("/seeds", seedsRoute);

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  const seeds = await Seed.find();
  res.render("index", { seeds: seeds });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Let’s go back to the `index.ejs` file and all a cell at the end of each row with the form and a delete button. We can set the method of the form to `POST` and still use this request to delete seeds, all we have to do is inject our desired seedId into the action parameter of the form and then add `_method=DELETE` to the end! This way the form is dynamically linked to each entry as it’s rendered on the page, allowing us to follow a route for that specific seedId. 

```html
<td>
  <form action="/seeds/<%= seed.id %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger">DELETE</button>
  </form>
</td>
```

Unless something has gone terribly wrong, we should have the ability to add and delete seeds from our cloud database! We can also use `router.patch()` for updating database entries, but let’s just leave it at deleting. [Here's a video demonstration of the finished application and instructions for connecting the database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5Wc-Tssac).

That’s all for now! This tutorial could go on, and honestly it sort of did despite my efforts to cut the word count. We can apply the principals here to build this type of application as extensively as we’d like; I’ll likely add schemas and routes for fresh peppers, pepper plants, dried peppers, etc. We also can include the functionality to log in, hash passwords, validate sessions, sanitize inputs, live search the database, and literally anything else you can think of. 

Thanks for reading!
