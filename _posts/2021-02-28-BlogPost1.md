Hello, welcome to a blog where I talk about learning NodeJS and why it's the greatest thing ever.

### What is NodeJS and why is it important?

If you have any experience in software development, web development, or have been on the internet you've probably heard of NodeJS. But what exactly is it? Truthfully, if someone had asked me to explain it a few months ago I probably could have told them it had something to do with server-side JavaScript but that was the extent of my understanding. At the time, it seemed like this big intimidating thing that was way over my head and I didn’t really know where to start. Well, a semester of coding web applications with Java servlets was all the motivation I needed to dive further into NodeJS and I’ve discovered that it is literally the greatest thing ever (in my opinion). In this post I’d like to take you through the steps I’ve taken to learn this amazing tool and backup my very good opinion with some cold, hard facts. 

##### [Step 1: Buy NodeJS sticker for your laptop or water bottle.](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/nodejs+stickers)

This will immediately let people know that you are on the bleeding edge of web technology... Just kidding, NodeJS is actually over a decade old. That being said, the fact that is remains relevant in the quickly advancing world of web technology is a testament to its usefulness!

##### [Step 2: Google "what is nodejs"](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=what+is+nodejs)

So, once again, what exactly is NodeJS? When I first started talking to people about this topic, there seemed to be a lot of ambiguity around whether it was a programming language, a framework, a library, or something else entirely. A quick look at the official site tells us:

> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

That answers at least one question: NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. Simply put, it allows us to use JavaScript for a much wider range of applications by providing a runtime environment beyond the browser. This revelation creates endless new opportunities for JavaScript to be used in standalone applications and allows full-stack web developers to code in a single language for the front-end and back-end. But wait, there’s more! 

> Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

Ah yes, just how I like my web apps: lightweight and efficient. If you didn't already know, thread based networking is neither of those things; using the traditional concurrency model we would have to start a new thread for each request. Since JavaScript is a "single-threaded" scripting language, this presents a huge problem for handling multiple events. Right? Nope. JavaScripts asynchronous nature lends itself perfectly to a non-blocking I/O model. Input/Output operations take time, but since NodeJS functions rarely perform these operations directly we don't need to be concerned about request volume hanging up our application. This where the true power of NodeJS lies: scalability. Since no process ever blocks, the same system could reasonably be used to handle 10 requests or 10000 requests. 

> Node.js’ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

Node Package Manager (npm) is truly the cherry on top of the NodeJS sundae. Want to setup a web server with 3 lines of code instead of the usual 10 or so NodeJS requires? Toss an `npm install express --save` on the ol' command line and you're basically there. Exploring the incredible ecosystem of open source libraries you can access through npm is an excellent use of your time. 


##### Step 3: Remember JavaScript 

Full disclaimer, I love JavaScript. At the end of a long day of writing Java I love to pull the plug on the rusty old JVM, cast aside burdensome things like semicolons, and accomplish the exact same thing with 30% of the code. If I have my way, I will spend my career writing JavaScript.
