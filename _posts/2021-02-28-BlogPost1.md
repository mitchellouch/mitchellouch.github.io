Hello, welcome to a blog where I talk about learning NodeJS and convince you that it's the greatest thing ever.

### What is NodeJS and why is it important? 

![alt text.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Node.js_logo.svg/1200px-Node.js_logo.svg.png "nodelogo")

If you have any experience in software development, web development, or have been on the internet you've probably heard of NodeJS. But what exactly is it? Truthfully, if someone had asked me to explain it a few months ago I probably could have told them it had something to do with server-side JavaScript but that was the extent of my understanding. At the time, it seemed like this big intimidating thing that was way over my head and I didn’t really know where to start. Well, a semester of coding web applications with Java servlets was all the motivation I needed to dive further into NodeJS and I’ve discovered that it is indeed the greatest thing ever (in my opinion). In this post I’d like to take you through the steps I’ve taken to learn this amazing tool and backup my very good opinion with some cold, hard facts. 

##### [Step 1: Buy NodeJS sticker for your laptop or water bottle.](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/nodejs+stickers)

The first step to becoming a legitimate NodeJS developer, is looking like a legitimate NodeJS developer. Slap that sticker on the front of your laptop to immediately increase confidence and credibility. 

##### [Step 2: Google "what is nodejs"](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=what+is+nodejs)

So, once again, what exactly is NodeJS? When I first started talking to people about this topic, there seemed to be a lot of ambiguity around whether it was a programming language, a framework, a library, or something else entirely. A quick look at the official site tells us:

> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

That answers at least one question: NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. Simply put, it allows us to use JavaScript for a much wider range of applications by providing a runtime environment beyond the browser. This revelation creates endless new opportunities for JavaScript to be used in standalone applications and allows full-stack web developers to code in a single language for the front-end and back-end. But wait, there’s more! 

> Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

Ah yes, just how I like my web apps: lightweight and efficient. If you didn't already know, thread based networking is neither of those things; using the traditional concurrency model we would have to start a new thread for each request. Since JavaScript is a "single-threaded" scripting language, this presents a huge problem for handling multiple events. Right? Nope. JavaScripts asynchronous nature lends itself perfectly to a non-blocking I/O model. Input/Output operations take time, but since NodeJS functions rarely perform these operations directly we don't need to be concerned about request volume hanging up our application. This where the true power of NodeJS lies: scalability. Since no process ever blocks, the same system could reasonably be used to handle 10 requests or 10000 requests. Here's a great example: 


```javascript
server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  console.log("Server running!")
})
```


Using a callback function on a basic web server allows us to perform operations concurrently anytime a request is made to the server. Otherwise, the server simply listens and waits for requests. Ultimately, this means that if two users connect to the server, the application doesn't have to wait for the first user's request to be processed before processing the second user's request. 

> Node.js’ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

Node Package Manager (npm) is truly the cherry on top of the NodeJS sundae. Want to setup a web server with 3 lines of code instead of the usual 10 or so NodeJS requires? Throw an `npm install express --save` on the ol' command line and you're basically there. Exploring the incredible ecosystem of open source libraries you can access through npm is an excellent use of your time. 


##### Step 3: Remember JavaScript 
Full disclaimer, I love JavaScript. At the end of a long day of writing Java I love to pull the plug on the rusty old JVM, cast aside burdensome things like semicolons, and accomplish the same thing with 30% of the code. If I have my way, I will spend my career writing JavaScript. I didn’t have very much time to practice writing JavaScript during the previous semester, so I had to spend some time brushing up before I felt prepared to tackle NodeJS. Here’s a few important JavaScript concepts that greatly improved my understanding of the language, and its efficacy within the NodeJS environment:

###### 1.	Asynchronous programming 
Asynchronous programming is exactly what it sounds like: a complicated JavaScript thing. Fortunately, it’s not actually very complicated. The functions of a synchronous program are read and executed one at a time, from the top to the bottom of the code. An asynchronous program is read in the same fashion, but with one major difference: along the way, certain asynchronous functions will begin to execute concurrently to the rest of the code as it continues on another thread. This will occur for every asynchronous function in the program, which basically just means that these functions can potentially execute in any sequence unless told otherwise. Here’s a basic example using the asynchronous function `setTimeout()`:

```javascript
let user1 = Mitchell
let user2 = Bob
let user3 = Joe

console.log(user1)
console.log(user2)
console.log(user3)
```

If we executed this code, the output in the console would be:
`Mitchell`
`Bob`
`Joe`

However, if I wanted my name to appear at the end of the list (I’m Mitchell) we can use the setTimeout() function to asynchronously execute another function that says “Mitchell” after a certain amount of time. 

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(user1)
}, 500)
console.log(user2)
console.log(user3)
```

If we executed this code, the output in the console would be:
`Bob`
`Joe`
`Mitchell`

Meanwhile, the rest of the program continues as normal and then, once the predetermined amount (500ms in this case) of time is over, my name is added at the end of the list (even though that function is above the other two)! On one hand, this is extremely powerful for the event-driven applications we are likely to develop with NodeJS. On the other hand, without fairly extensive foresight, an asynchronous program can quickly become overcomplicated and difficult to use. Speaking of which, let's step into callback hell for a moment.

###### 2.	Callback functions 
![alt text.](https://brunolm.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/hadouken-code.jpg?w=625&h=364g "callbackhell")

Callback functions are an excellent tool for programming asynchronously. In a few words, they are functions that are passed into another function as an arguement and executed upon its completion. This is made even more useful by callback function's ability to perform further operations upon the result of its parent function. Let's take a more in depth look at the server example from earler:

```javascript
const http = require('http')
const host = '127.0.0.1'
const port = 3000

server.listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${host}:${port}/`)
})
```

Here, we are passing the port and host (localhost:3000) into the .listen function which is asynchronously listening for http requests on the specified port. Now, what about this funny looking third argument being passed: `() => {}` This one of a few ways to use a callback function, you can write anything you want to happen when a request is processed between the {}. Essentially, the callback function that prints to the console is fired with each new connection, and if there are no connections to be processed the NodeJS runtime goes back to sleep.

###### 3.	Promises
A Promise in JavaScript is also exactly what it sounds like: we're promising to do a certain action at a later time which is either resolved or rejected. Like callback functions, promises are a useful approach to asynchronous programming because they allow us to associate events with the eventual success or failure of an asynchronous event. Rather than immediately returning a value like a synchronous function, an asynchronous function can instead return a promise to deliver the value at some point in the future. Here is an example of a basic promise:

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let user1 = Mitchell
  if (user1.equals('Mitchell')) {
    resolve('Hey, it's me.')
  } else {
    resolve('That ain't me!')
  }
})
```

If that looks different from the previous examples, it's just another syntax for using a callback function! Now all we need to do is tell the program what we want to happen when the promise is resolved:

```javascript
promise.then((message) => {
  console.log(message)
}).catch((message) => {
  console.log(message)
})
```

Anything within the `.then()` method will run when our promise is resolved! In this case, the message being passed in if user1 is equal to "Mitchell" is `Hey, it's me!`. If we change the value of user1 to anything other than "Mitchell", the `.catch()` method will display the message `That ain't me!` as the failure condition. 

###### 4.	Async/await 

You can easily turn any function into an asynchronous function using the `async` keyword (i.e. telling the function to return a promise rather than a value). In combination of the `await` keyword, which only works within async functions, we can obtain a bit more control over our asynchronous processes. The `await` keyword can be placed before any promise-based function to halt the code on that line until the promise is fulfilled. For example, we could pause an asynchronous function until a fetch on a large file is complete and then immediately do all of our usual error checking and whatnot __WITHOUT__ chaining a bunch of `.then()` functions. Where we would usually have to do something silly like this:

```javascript
fetch('mitchell.jpg')
  .then(response => {})
  .then(image => {})
  .catch(error => {}))
```

In the first .then() function we pass the response and a callback function that makes sure it returns status: ok (or 200) once the response is complete. In the second .then() function we pass the image we received from the response, and a callback function that will prepare the file to be added to the page. Finally, in the .catch() function we pass an error, as well as a callback function to display some sort of error code. Like I said: silly. With the `async` and `await` keywords we can easily accomplish the same thing with a higher level of precision and much cleaner code. 

```javascript
async function fetching() {
  let res = await fetch('mitchell.jpg')
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error(`ITS NOT OKAY!\n Status: ${res.status}`)
  } else {
    let image = document.createElement('img')
    image.src = "./mitchell.jpg"
    document.body.appendChild(image)
  }
}

fetching().catch(error => {
	console.log('fetch was not successful')
})
```

Avoiding a huge chain of .then() blocks will likely save you alot of headache when writing asynchronous functions. It's a great tool that allows us to make asynchronous code behave more synchronously, which is counter intuitive for some applications but absolutely essential for others. 


##### Step 4: Hello World! 
![alt text.](https://i.imgur.com/ERvJfDO.jpeg "very good meme")

You might be thinking: "Isn't this supposed to be a blog about NodeJS? I just spent an eternity reading about a bunch of JavaScript stuff, where's the Node at?" Not to worry, the time has come for us to create an extremely cool Hello World app and run it in the NodeJS environment! If you want to make one as well, start by downloading NodeJS from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). I've spent so much time on there lately, Netflix is no longer the first thing to come up when I type "n" in Chrome...

![alt text.](https://i.imgur.com/9Yi5xTL.png "This is fine")

Once you've downloaded and installed NodeJS, you can double check that it's been installed with one easy command! Open up a terminal and type: `node -v`. If all is well you should see something along the lines of `v14.15.1` (your version may be different due to the relentless and cruel passage of time). Next go ahead and fire up your favorite editor - I would recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can also do this with something like SublimeText or Notepad. Regardless of your choice, create a file called firstApp.js and add a bit of JavaScript:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!")
```

Back in your terminal, navigate to the folder where you stored the JavaScript file and enter `node firstApp.js` to run your application! In the console you should now see a triumphant `Hello World!` indicating that you have successfully run your NodeJS application. Not impressed? Sure, it doesn't look like much but do you realize what we've done?! We just ran a JavaScript application and Chrome, Firefox and the other one didn't even know about it. In other words, we just ran JavaScript outside of the web browser that held it captive for so many years. And that's cool as hell if you ask me.

But if you're still not convinced that NodeJS is the pinnacle of human achievement, maybe this will get you there. Let's quickly (yes, quickly) setup the HTTP server we looked at in the earlier examples. In your same firstApp.js file add this magical line of code (and a few others while you're at it):

```javascript
const http = require('http')
const host = "127.0.0.1"
const port = 3000
```

The `require` keyword allows us to easily import modules that come with NodeJS from the Node.js API. It can also install third-party libraries from npm but we're not going to do that quite yet! Other than that, we're just setting some variables for the host name and port number for our server. Next let's set up the server using the http module we just loaded: 

```javascript
const server = http.createServer(req, res)
```

Yeah, it's that easy. Let's go a bit wild and also pass a callback function to the `createServer()` function:

```javascript
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain")
  res.end("Hello World!")
})
```

All we're doing here is creating a function that sets up the response our new server will send when it receives requests! First we set the status code to 200 (which means OK), then we set the content type in the header to "text/plain", and finally we send the response `Hello World!`. Almost there, just one more step! Let's add an asynchronous function to listen for requests on the server just like we did in the previous example:

```javascript
server.listen(port, host)
```

Once again, it's that easy. Once again, let's pass a callback function to let us know that the server is up and running!

```javascript
server.listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${host}:${port}/`)
})
```

Nice, all done. Let's run it! Back in your terminal (if you closed it, navigate back to the folder with your firstApp.js file) run the same command as before: `node firstApp.js`. You should now see `Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/` in your console! Now that we know the server is up and running, let's send it a request by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` in the browser (localhost on port 3000).

Behold, the glory of NodeJS. Try not to look directly at it. 





##### Step 5: Oh, that's it?
